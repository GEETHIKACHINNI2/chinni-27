        "### Questions to Think About and Answer\n",
        "1. Why does the TF-IDF approach generally result in a better accuracy than Bag-of-Words ?\n",
        "The **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** approach generally results in **better accuracy** than **Bag-of-Words (BoW)** in many **text classification** and **information retrieval** tasks due to the way it handles word importance. Let's break down the key reasons why **TF-IDF** tends to outperform **BoW**:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **BoW Treats All Words Equally**:\n",
        "   - In **BoW**, each word in the document is treated as a feature, and the feature vector simply counts how often each word appears in the document, regardless of how common or rare the word is across the entire corpus.\n",
        "   - This means that in **BoW**, common words like \"the\", \"is\", \"and\", \"in\", etc., are treated the same as more informative words like \"disease\", \"stock\", or \"recommendation\", even though common words carry little to no useful information for classification tasks.\n",
        "   - **TF-IDF**, on the other hand, adjusts for this by giving higher weight to **rare words** and reducing the weight of **frequent words** that occur across many documents. This makes the feature vectors more **discriminative** and better suited for distinguishing between documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) Reduces the Impact of Common Words**:\n",
        "   - The **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)** component of **TF-IDF** helps adjust for the **universal importance** of words. Words that appear frequently across many documents (like \"the\", \"and\", \"is\") will have a low IDF score, meaning their contribution to the model is reduced.\n",
        "   - This is crucial because if a word appears in almost every document, it doesn’t provide any useful information to distinguish between classes or topics. **TF-IDF** diminishes the effect of such words, allowing more **informative words** to stand out.\n",
        "   - For example, in a **text classification task** for spam detection, the word \"free\" may be more relevant for distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails, whereas \"the\" or \"from\" is not. **TF-IDF** reduces the weight of \"the\" and increases the weight of \"free\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Term Frequency (TF) Adjusts for Word Relevance within a Document**:\n",
        "   - The **Term Frequency (TF)** part of **TF-IDF** considers how often a word appears in a document, which helps capture the **importance of a word** within a specific context.\n",
        "   - This makes **TF-IDF** sensitive to the **local context** of a word in a document. If a word appears multiple times in a document, it indicates that the word might be more important to the document's content, and this is reflected in the model.\n",
        "   - In contrast, **BoW** simply counts word occurrences and doesn't consider the relative importance of those words within each document.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Better Differentiation Between Documents**:\n",
        "   - Since **TF-IDF** considers both **local word frequency** (TF) and the **global document frequency** (IDF), it helps **discriminate between documents** more effectively.\n",
        "   - Documents that contain **unique or rare words** (according to the IDF) will have higher **TF-IDF scores** for those words, making them more **distinctive** from other documents.\n",
        "   - This **discriminatory power** helps in classification tasks, where the goal is to differentiate between classes or topics based on the words present in the documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Improved Performance in Sparse Data**:\n",
        "   - In scenarios where **sparse data** exists (e.g., short text, or documents with very specific jargon), **TF-IDF**'s ability to assign higher weight to **rare but informative words** helps improve the model’s ability to generalize from limited data.\n",
        "   - **BoW**, however, might overemphasize frequently occurring words that don’t help in distinguishing document classes, especially in specialized or domain-specific datasets.\n",

        "   - In **information retrieval** systems, **TF-IDF** is widely used because it helps rank documents based on the **relevance** of query terms. It identifies documents that are **more relevant** to a search query by focusing on words that are more informative (i.e., appear in fewer documents).\n",

        "#### **How It Works:**\n",
        "Contextualized word embeddings represent words dynamically based on the **context** in which they appear.

        "\n",
        "### **1. Stemming**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **What is Stemming?**\n",
        "Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its **root form** by chopping off suffixes and prefixes, typically using a set of predefined rules. The result may not always be a valid word in the dictionary, but it helps reduce word variations to a common base form for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Examples**:\n",
        "- \"running\" → \"run\"\n",
        "- \"better\" → \"better\" (stemmer might remove \"er\" and get \"bett\")\n",
        "- \"happily\" → \"happi\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Pros of Stemming**:\n",
        "1. **Simplicity and Speed**: Stemming is typically **faster** than lemmatization because it uses simple heuristic rules (like removing suffixes) rather than relying on a more complex understanding of words.\n",
        "2. **Basic Root Form**: For many applications, particularly those involving large datasets, stemming might work sufficiently well to group together words with similar meanings.\n",
        "3. **Less Resource Intensive**: Stemming doesn't require access to large lexical databases like WordNet (used by lemmatizers), making it less computationally expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Cons of Stemming**:\n",
        "1. **Over-Stemming**: Since stemmers use rule-based heuristics, they may result in words being reduced to non-dictionary roots that are **too broad** or **inaccurate**. For example, \"flying\" and \"fly\" may both stem to \"fli\", which can lose the semantic distinction between the two.\n",
        "2. **Ambiguity**: Stemmers are not context-aware. Words that may have different meanings can end up with the same stem. For example, \"universal\" might stem to \"univers\", and \"universe\" might also stem to \"univers\", even though the contexts could differ.\n",
        "3. **Not Always Linguistically Correct**: The output of stemming may not always be a valid or meaningful word. For instance, \"happily\" becomes \"happi\", which is not a valid word.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Use Cases for Stemming**:\n",
        "- **Information Retrieval**: Where exact matching is not necessary, and you want to group together words with similar meanings.\n",
        "- **Search Engines**: For queries that need to find documents containing related word forms, stemming is used to ensure that variations of a word are matched.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **What is Lemmatization?**\n",
        "Lemmatization is the process of reducing a word to its **base or dictionary form**, called a \"lemma.\" Unlike stemming, which removes affixes, lemmatization involves understanding the **context** of the word and ensuring that the resulting word is a **valid word** in the dictionary. Lemmatization typically requires knowledge of the part-of-speech (POS) of the word.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Examples**:\n",
        "- \"running\" → \"run\"\n",
        "- \"better\" → \"good\" (because \"better\" is a comparative form of \"good\")\n",
        "- \"happily\" → \"happy\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Pros of Lemmatization**:\n",
        "1. **Linguistic Accuracy**: Lemmatization ensures that the **output** is always a **valid word** in the language. It preserves the meaning of words and keeps the correct form (e.g., \"running\" → \"run\", not \"runn\").\n",
        "2. **Context-Aware**: Lemmatization takes into account the **part-of-speech (POS)** of the word. For example, \"better\" will be lemmatized to \"good\" (adjective), while \"run\" will stay as \"run\" (verb).\n",
        "3. **Meaning Preservation**: Lemmatization preserves **semantic meaning** better than stemming. The base form of a word represents its actual meaning, and lemmatization ensures that this meaning is retained.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Cons of Lemmatization**:\n",
        "1. **Slower and More Computationally Intensive**: Lemmatization involves complex processes like looking up words in a **lexical database** (e.g., **WordNet**) and determining the correct POS. This makes lemmatization slower and more resource-intensive than stemming.\n",
        "2. **Requires POS Tagging**: Lemmatization often requires additional information such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, which adds complexity. For instance, \"better\" can be lemmatized to \"good\" (adjective) or \"well\" (adverb) depending on the context, and this requires accurate tagging.\n",
        "3. **Dependency on Lexical Databases**: Since lemmatization relies on resources like **WordNet** or other dictionaries, it might not work well for domain-specific words or neologisms not present in the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Use Cases for Lemmatization**:\n",
        "- **Text Classification**: Where preserving the **precise meaning** of words is important, such as in sentiment analysis, where words like \"better\" and \"good\" need to be treated as equivalents.\n",
